## Abstract

Forecasting systems for harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming more common, as HAB monitoring efforts are increasingly networked and aggregated at national and global levels. Ocean forecasting programs in other fields, however, have been seen to have unintended consequences and out-of-scope uses. The field of Data Justice provides a framework for understanding unintended harms caused by the application of data technologies generally, from predictive policing to technological redlining, and is now starting to be applied to environmental fields. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence algorithms and widespread environmental surveillance, it is timely to turn the data justice lens toward environmental applications, such as the prediction of HABs. This study attempts to orient the HAB forecasting enterprise within the emerging field of Ocean Data Justice. We surveyed three global data repositories underpinning HAB monitoring and prediction efforts: the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, the Harmful Algae Event Database, and AlgaeBase, as well as a literature corpus and the ocean forecasting literature. The patterns we found largely reinforce the existing economic and political relations that underpin global ocean stresses, with monitoring and knowledge generally concentrated in high-GDP, northern North Atlantic nations.
