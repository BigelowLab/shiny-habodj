## Abstract

Forecasting systems for harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming more common, as HAB monitoring efforts are increasingly networked and aggregated at national and global levels. However, ocean forecasting programs in other fields, have on occasion led to unintended consequences and out-of-scope uses. The field of Data Justice provides a framework for understanding unintended harms caused by the application of data technologies generally, such as predictive policing or technological redlining, and is now starting to be applied to environmental fields. This study attempts to orient the HAB forecasting enterprise within the emerging field of Ocean Data Justice. We surveyed three global data repositories underpinning HAB monitoring and prediction efforts: the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), the Harmful Algae Event Database (HAEDAT), and AlgaeBase, as well as a literature corpus and the ocean forecasting literature. The patterns we found largely reinforce the existing economic and political relations that underpin global ocean stresses, with monitoring and knowledge generally concentrated in high-GDP, northern North Atlantic nations. Design Justice and Algorithmic Accountability offer frameworks for better construction of and appropriate use of these databases.
